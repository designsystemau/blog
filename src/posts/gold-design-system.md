### Renamed to GOLD Design System  
 
Remember this old chestnut?:

Today, GOLD is back!

GOLD stands for Government Open Language of Design. GOLD was the original name of the system that was changed to Australian Government Design System soon after it launched.
 
The Technical Steering Committe (TSC) agreed to a name change via RFC process, full details can be read at the [pull request](https://github.com/designsystemau/RFCs/pull/8/files).  

There was agreement that the name change was an appropriate identity change marking the end of DTA's custodianship of the project.

In addition, from the RFC:

> having a fun name (as opposed to a plain language name) has the effect of "creating shared language" and is better to "excite people about working together, "particularly non-technical people. That this is beneficial for "creating unity and delight" and gives your people an identity.

 
### New docs site

Docs are available at [https://gold.designsystemau.org/](https://gold.designsystemau.org/), which should now be used instead of the DTA's decommissioned docs site.
 
The code can be found at [Github](https://github.com/designsystemau/gold-design-system-site).
 

### New npm packages

Npm packages are available at the new [@gold.au organisation](https://www.npmjs.com/org/gold.au).

If you're using modules, you can now install packages:

    npm install @gold.au/button
    
or change components in an existing package.json by replacing `@gov/au` with `@gold.au`, leaving the package versions unchanged.  
    
Alternatively, static assets can be download at [https://gold.designsystemau.org/download/](https://gold.designsystemau.org/download/).

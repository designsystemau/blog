Following a change in mandate, the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA) is no longer supporting the Australian Government Design System (AuDS). An open collective including public sector workers, developers, designers, accessibility experts and others has been established in response to this change. 

Operating under the name Design System AU, the group will be providing ongoing support, maintenance and development for AuDS, ensuring that websites that utilise the System can continue to benefit from future updates. An incomplete reference of sites will be [showcased here](https://github.com/designsystemau/showcase).

AuDS is a free reusable starting point for building Government website and application interfaces (frontend). It is built on inclusive design principles, meets accessibility standards, is tested with users and is themeable - to satisfy a range of government brand requirements. This allows Government entities to meet best practice requirements, and eliminates the need to repeatedly rebuild system components, saving time and resources.

There is no directive for Government entities to use the System, however, AuDS has been used extensively on its merits and in the spirit of supporting what it is trying to achieve. With so many active dependents on the System, its cessation could have resulted in end-of-life for ongoing projects, as bugs would not be fixed or kept up to date.

Under the new governance, Government groups can once again have confidence that questions they have of the System will be answered, and to the benefit of all they will be empowered to contribute back to the System.

This co-ownership will result in a more precise tool and ensure the AuDS will be sustained and well-governed independently from any one specific agency or change in Government or policy.

Design System AU are passionate about the vital role of the AuDS in delivering better Government services. It is our belief that the most viable way to see the System sustained and continued without the DTA is via the open source community, driven at heart by Government representatives.
